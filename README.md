# dotfiles-sh

Personal `*sh` configuration files of Tyler Ware.

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/waretyler/dotfiles-sh
make install
```

## Design
My dotfiles are built on the following principles

1) Fiddle free: After install it should just work
2) Dynamic: Configuration respects various environments (shell, term, os) and installed tools 

## Plans
Migrate these to main dotfiles repo.
